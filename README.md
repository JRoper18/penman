# Penman
Penman is a simple script for processing AMR Graphs in Penman notation.

Usage: AMRParser has literally one method, it's called "parse", and it returns an AMR graph. This can't possibly be that complicated. 

Time took to write: A few hours. 

TODO: Tests, reification, encoding, and concept inventory data on AMR types. 

Q: When will changes be made? A: When someone else does them or when I need them. 

Q: This isn't enough code to warrant it's own repo. A: Yup.
